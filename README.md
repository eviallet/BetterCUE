# BetterCUE
Simple program that allow to control Corsair keyboards without using iCUE using the [official SDK](http://forum.corsair.com/v3/showthread.php?t=179027).

For now, all it can do is making A...Z keys pick a random color each second, and it is started by a GUI. However, it is very easy to add more abilities - make it better than iCUE !
